Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

Step 4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand, so follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:
```text
1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
3. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
4. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
```
